# javascript_calculator

This is a basic calculator that I built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Although it is nothing fancy and would have taken less code with using a framework, I believe making it without one taught me alot about how JavaScript interacts with the DOM, and I believe that every developer should understand the basics of JavaScript before moving on to learning a Framework.

Feel free to clone this, make changes to it, do what ever you want. If you see any improvements that can be made feel free to let me know :)
